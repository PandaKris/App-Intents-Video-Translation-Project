00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:02,969
Hi! In the last video, we created

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:04,337
an App intent that receives

3
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:06,373
a parameter and returns a value.

4
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:09,576
We also manually create a shortcut

5
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:12,212
that uses this value in a sequence of actions.

6
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,447
Now, let's check another

7
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,416
result an App Intent can provide

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,717
and how to create

9
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,085
a shortcut programmatically.

10
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:20,220
Let's Code!

11
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,225
In our ProductDetailIntent

12
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,926
perform function, let's add

13
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:28,995
Provides Dialog as a return,

14
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,231
so we return a dialog

15
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,133
to present it in a interactive way.

16
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:35,902
Here, we added

17
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,704
provides dialog as a return

18
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,773
of our intent perform function.

19
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,475
It gives us a dialog

20
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,411
as output in addition

21
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,580
to the return value that we also kept.

22
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,016
We added the IntentDialog

23
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,851
to the resulting structure

24
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:55,288
so the user can use these when

25
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,856
interacting with this intent.

26
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,193
We now have two possible ways of

27
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,995
interacting with our intent.

28
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:04,364
Let's create

29
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,533
a shortcut that uses our intent.

30
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,872
Let's rename it to My Coffee Shortcut.

31
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,112
Now, when using this shortcut,

32
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,513
it presents us the

33
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,082
dialog to input the product

34
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,316
and it presents the

35
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,218
output also in our dialog.

36
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,822
We can add the shortcut, set the

37
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:30,190
parameter in the intent

38
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,592
itself and it will use this

39
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,894
parameter to give us the price without

40
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:36,229
asking for the parameter.

41
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,734
In this video, we learn how to interact

42
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,069
with our intent using

43
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,871
shortcuts and dialogs.

44
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,407
In the next video, let's check how to

45
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,042
interact with it using Siri.

46
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:50,243
See you there!
