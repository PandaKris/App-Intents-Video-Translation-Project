00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,702
Hi! In this video, we are going to create

2
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:04,304
a shortcut using the app

3
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:06,272
intent we built in our last video.

4
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,708
We'll see how easy it is to turn

5
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:10,076
an intent into a shortcut

6
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,178
with very little extra code.

7
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,749
We also explore how to customize it.

8
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,987
Now, let's create a shortcut using

9
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,722
the app intent we built earlier.

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,658
We start by creating a new structure

11
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,193
called CoffeeShortcuts.

12
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,330
And we make it conform to the protocol

13
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,098
app shortcuts provider.

14
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,368
This tells the system that this structure

15
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,904
will provide shortcuts for our app.

16
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:42,175
Inside it, we must define a static list

17
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,710
called "appShortcuts",

18
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:45,478
where we can register

19
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,080
one or more shortcuts.

20
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:51,317
Here, we create a shortcut based on

21
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,986
the Open Favorites intent.

22
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:57,323
We also define a list of phrases that

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,793
the user can say to activate this shortcut.

24
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,797
In this case, open My Favorites,

25
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,498
followed by the app's name automatically.

26
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,135
These phrases are especially important

27
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,504
because they allow the user to interact

28
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,306
with the shortcut through Siri.

29
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,876
For now, we are keeping it simple

30
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,478
with just one phrase,

31
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,346
but in the next video,

32
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,949
we explore how to work with multiple phrases

33
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,351
and make this interaction even more powerful.

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,656
Finally, we give the shortcut

35
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:30,890
a "Short Title", which will be

36
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,659
displayed in the Shortcuts app.

37
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,428
And we set an icon for it using

38
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,564
the system image called "Heart.fill".

39
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,568
With just this, our shortcut is ready

40
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:42,068
and will appear

41
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,037
automatically in the Shortcuts app.

42
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,573
Now let's take a look at the result.

43
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,309
When you run the app and open

44
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,278
the Shortcuts app, we can already see our

45
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,947
new shortcut listed automatically.

46
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,149
It shows the title and the icon

47
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,785
we defined in the code, and it's fully ready

48
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,253
for the user to trigger

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,188
manually or by using Siri.

50
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,624
This integration happened

51
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,659
with just a few lines of code.

52
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,829
In addition to using the shortcuts inside

53
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,832
the Shortcuts app, the user can also

54
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,601
add it directly to the home screen.

55
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,804
This way, they can launch the shortcut

56
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,940
just like they would open a regular app,

57
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,876
making the experience even

58
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,444
faster and more convenient.

59
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,580
It's important to know that your app

60
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,249
can provide up to 10 shortcuts.

61
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,385
They will appear in the Shortcuts app

62
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,555
following the exact order you defined in

63
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,323
the array inside Coffee Shortcuts.

64
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,227
So, the first shortcut you add will be

65
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:41,928
the first shown

66
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,429
to the user, and so on.

67
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,200
And that's it!

68
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,102
Our first shortcut is working.

69
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,971
With just a few lines of code,

70
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,607
we connected our app to the shortcut system

71
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,043
and even made it possible for users

72
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,444
to add it to their home screen.

73
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,980
In the next video, we'll see how to use

74
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,482
Siri and Spotlight

75
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,816
to access this shortcut.

76
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,585
Thanks for watching and

77
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:06,786
I'll see you in the next video.
