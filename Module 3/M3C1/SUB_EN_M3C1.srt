00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:02,769
Hi! In this video, we are starting our

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,838
hands-on journey with App Intents

3
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:06,439
by showing the sample app

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,441
we will use in this course.

5
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,644
It's a simple coffee shop app made

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:12,846
to help us focus

7
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:14,681
on creating and testing intents.

8
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,684
We'll show the main screens,

9
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:18,985
talk about the tools we are using,

10
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,454
and explain how the app is set up to make

11
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,089
learning App Intents easier.

12
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:26,960
Now, let's talk about

13
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,228
the tools we are using.

14
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,864
I'm running macOS version

15
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,101
15.4.1 and Xcode version 16.3.

16
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,871
If you are using macOS 15

17
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:40,106
or higher and Xcode 16 or above,

18
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,674
everything should work

19
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,243
just fine for this project.

20
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,946
I'm going to give you a quick demo

21
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,882
of the app we will use during this course.

22
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,117
It's a coffee shop app

23
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,752
with a few simple screens.

24
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,954
This is the menu, where

25
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,156
you can see a list of drinks

26
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,724
and snacks inspired by

27
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,825
coffee break traditions

28
00:00:58,992 --> 00:00:59,993
from different countries.

29
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:03,897
It's a simple screen where

30
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,799
you can see each item's name,

31
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,867
price, and buttons to add

32
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,769
your favorites or to your bag.

33
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,772
This is where your favorite items appear.

34
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,209
If you go back to the menu,

35
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,945
tap the heart on one item

36
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,114
and return to the favorite screen,

37
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,615
you can see that the

38
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,384
item has been added here.

39
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,189
This screen shows the

40
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,490
orders you have made.

41
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,026
For now, we already have some

42
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:34,627
example orders listed here.

43
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,995
And when you add items

44
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,597
to your bag, they show up here.

45
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,567
If we go back to the menu, add an item

46
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,035
and return to the Bag screen,

47
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:45,071
you can change the quantity and

48
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,973
when you are ready, you can place an order.

49
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,311
This app was made simple on purpose,

50
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:53,713
so we can focus on learning how to use

51
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,181
App Intents without distractions.

52
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,319
For now, the list of items is fixed

53
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,387
and all of the data is saved only in memory.

54
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:02,622
There is no database

55
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:03,923
or permanent storage.

56
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,427
In the next videos, we'll start adding

57
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,462
App Intent files step by step.

58
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,798
And you only need to change

59
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,333
the app's code when it's really

60
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,268
necessary for a specific intent.

61
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:17,971
You can download the sample

62
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,073
project from the video page.

63
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,610
I recommend opening it in Xcode and

64
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:24,677
taking a few minutes

65
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,112
to explore the files and get

66
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,515
familiar with how the app is structured.

67
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,917
Don't worry, you don't need to understand

68
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,619
or memorize all of the code.

69
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,522
As we add App Intents in the next lessons,

70
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,290
we'll mostly be

71
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,125
writing new files, and in

72
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,760
most cases, we won't need

73
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,295
to change the existing code.

74
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,966
Thanks for watching, and we appreciate

75
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,801
you joining us on this journey.

76
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,437
In the next lessons, we'll work directly

77
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,939
with this app and code

78
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,607
to add useful and fun

79
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,476
integrations using App Intents.

80
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,945
You'll see how easy it is to make

81
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,480
your app more powerful

82
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,048
and connected across the system.

83
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,583
See you in the next video.

84
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:04,217
Bye!
