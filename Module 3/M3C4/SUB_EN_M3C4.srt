00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:02,535
Hi! In this video, we are going to see

2
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:03,603
how to access this

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,605
shortcut we created using Siri.

4
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,441
We'll also explore how to add different

5
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,111
phrases to trigger the shortcut and check

6
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,246
how it appears in Spotlight Search.

7
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,218
The shortcut we created in the last video

8
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,253
is now fully integrated with Siri.

9
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,223
That means you can activate

10
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,392
it just by using your voice.

11
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,396
For example, you can say

12
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,564
"Open my favorites coffee" and

13
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,366
Siri will immediately run

14
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:34,834
the shortcut and open

15
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,503
the favorite screen in our app.

16
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,738
Now let's talk a bit more

17
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,273
about the Phrases property.

18
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,909
Each phrase you add here is interpreted

19
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,178
literally by Siri, so it's

20
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,813
important to think like your

21
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:49,449
users and try to anticipate the different

22
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,484
ways they might say the same command.

23
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,521
Also, every phrase must include the app's name.

24
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,557
That's why we use .applicationName

25
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,694
As a developer, it's a good practice

26
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,496
to provide several variations

27
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,998
of phrases for the same intent,

28
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,934
so users can naturally say what feels

29
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,602
right to them and still

30
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:10,904
get the expected result.

31
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,140
Here's an example where we added multiple

32
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,042
phrases to give the user more

33
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,777
flexibility when using Siri.

34
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,880
Now let's try out some of the phrases

35
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,916
we added and see how Siri responds.

36
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,585
I'm going to say a few

37
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:28,021
different variations, like 

38
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,857
"show my favorites in Coffee"

39
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,293
and "go to favorites in Coffee".

40
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,664
And as you will see, Siri correctly

41
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,766
recognizes each one and

42
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,401
runs the shortcut we created.

43
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,138
And the best part is that we don't need

44
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,740
to write any extra code for our shortcut

45
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:48,808
to appear in Spotlight.

46
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,878
The setup we already created is enough.

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,647
You can access it by pulling down to open

48
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:57,016
Spotlight and typing the name of the app

49
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,552
or even part of the shortcut's title.

50
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:04,424
And that's it for this

51
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,859
module, thanks for watching!

52
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,394
We have seen how to create an app intent,

53
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,964
turn it into a shortcut, and make it

54
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,999
accessible through Siri and Spotlight.

55
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,735
In the upcoming modules, we'll go further

56
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,970
and learn how to build

57
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,371
more complex intents,

58
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,273
integrated with additional system

59
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,875
features, to make your

60
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,243
app even more powerful.

61
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,678
Thanks for watching and I'll

62
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,046
see you in the next module.

63
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:27,780
Bye.
