00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:02,535
Hi! In this video, we'll show how to

2
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,404
customize the appearance of your app

3
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,339
shortcuts in the Shortcuts app.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,542
This is not a common topic and it's not

5
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:10,910
well documented, but it

6
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:12,412
can make a big difference.

7
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:15,248
We'll explain step by step how to define

8
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,149
the colors that the

9
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:17,917
system will use when displaying

10
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:18,752
your shortcuts.

11
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,523
By default, when you create an app

12
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,358
shortcut, the system uses

13
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,260
your app icon with standard

14
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,794
colors.

15
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,864
But, you can change these colors

16
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,232
to better match your brand.

17
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,535
You can customize both the foreground

18
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,470
and the background of the shortcut tile.

19
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,807
To change the shortcut appearance,

20
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,343
you need to edit your app's info.plist.

21
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,913
You will add a section under

22
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,082
the CFBundleIcons key, where

23
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,417
you define color names.

24
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,253
These color names must match

25
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,355
colors in your asset catalog.

26
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,424
Here is the exact code you

27
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,292
should add to your info.plist.

28
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,595
The color names you define are up to you.

29
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,298
They don't need to be exactly ShortcutsForeground

30
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,801
or ShortcutsBackgroundTop.

31
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,503
What matters is that the names of your

32
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,639
info.plist match exactly

33
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,541
the color names in your asset

34
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:15,075
catalog.

35
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,044
Once that's done, create the matching

36
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,113
color sets in the asset catalog.

37
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,148
You can provide one or

38
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,450
two background colors.

39
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,219
If you use two, the system

40
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,954
will create a vertical gradient.

41
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,657
If you use just one, the

42
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,891
background will be solid.

43
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,295
The foreground color is used for the icon

44
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:36,896
and the text of the shortcut.

45
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,566
The background colors create the visual

46
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,134
base behind the icon.

47
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,904
This gives your shortcut a distinct

48
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,840
and branded appearance across the system.

49
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,042
Let's see a quick demo.

50
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:50,977
I added the keys to my

51
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,112
info.plist exactly as shown.

52
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,549
Then, in the asset catalog, I created

53
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,884
a white color called

54
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,952
ShortcutsForeground.

55
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,489
For the background, I used a gradient

56
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:03,790
from light green to a

57
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,391
bit darker, with the names

58
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,527
ShortcutsBackgroundTop and

59
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,095
ShortcutsBackgroundBottom.

60
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,333
After building and running the app,

61
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,834
I opened the shortcuts app.

62
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,036
Now, my shortcuts

63
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,538
appear with the new colors.

64
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,740
The gradient looks smooth

65
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,042
and the icon stands out nicely.

66
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,980
Customizing these colors gives your app

67
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,281
a more polished experience.

68
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,918
It shows attention to detail and improves

69
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,953
recognition inside the system.

70
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,257
Even though this is a small thing,

71
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,858
it helps your app stand out.

72
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,396
And that's it!

73
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,231
Now you know how to customize

74
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,833
the appearance of your app shortcuts.

75
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,402
It's a hidden feature, but it's easy

76
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,603
to implement and gives

77
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,604
a great visual result.

78
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:52,672
Thanks for watching!
