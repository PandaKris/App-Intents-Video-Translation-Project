00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:02,202
Hi! In this video, we are going to talk

2
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:03,670
about a specific use case

3
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,305
for App Intents and Shortcuts,

4
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,874
using the squeeze gesture on

5
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,376
the Apple Pencil Pro. This is a good

6
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:10,944
example of how flexible these

7
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,113
tools are and how they can adapt to many

8
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,247
different ways users

9
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:15,815
interact with their devices.

10
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,322
The squeeze gesture is a small,

11
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,557
quick action that users can do by gently

12
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:26,059
pressing the Apple Pencil Pro.

13
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,695
It can be linked to different

14
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,631
features like opening a tool palette

15
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,899
or changing drawing modes

16
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,135
without interrupting the flow of what

17
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,537
the user is doing. It is just

18
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,239
one of the many ways the system

19
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:41,007
can respond to personal interaction styles.

20
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,176
As shown in the settings,

21
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,145
users can choose what

22
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,880
happens when they squeeze the pencil.

23
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:48,782
Some of the options

24
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:50,417
include showing the tool palette,

25
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,186
switching between tools or opening

26
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,321
the color picker. One of the

27
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,890
most powerful options is

28
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:59,893
selecting a shortcut. This allows users

29
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,961
to define exactly what they want the

30
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:03,096
gestures to trigger,

31
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,465
giving them full control over

32
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,368
the experience. With iPadOS, users can

33
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,736
connect this gesture to

34
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,371
a shortcut they have created in the

35
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,973
Shortcuts app. That means they can build

36
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,208
an automation that runs

37
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,277
instantly when they squeeze the pencil.

38
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,279
It is a very specific

39
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:20,980
scenario but as developers,

40
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,216
we can use the same App Intents and

41
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,351
Shortcuts we have already defined

42
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,020
to support it. This shows

43
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,055
how the work we do to support system

44
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,657
integrations can unlock

45
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,725
a wide range of user experiences.

46
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,829
From Shortcuts placed on the home screen

47
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,597
to very detailed gestures

48
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,666
like this one. Let's look at

49
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,602
a few examples. In a sketching app,

50
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,103
a squeeze might open the

51
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,940
brush picker. In a writing app,

52
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:50,243
it could switch between tools. But a user

53
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,478
could also create

54
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,546
a shortcut that opens ChatGPT

55
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,316
to ask a quick question or one that

56
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,885
starts a timer or pastes

57
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,621
a predefined text. Even small

58
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,624
automations like this can help users feel

59
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,793
more in control.

60
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,795
This gesture is just one case but it

61
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,131
highlights the power of App Intents

62
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:13,266
and Shortcuts. They are not

63
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,401
only for large actions or voice

64
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,571
commands. They can also support small

65
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,039
and precise interactions that

66
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,574
feel personal and natural.

67
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,247
Thanks for watching. Whether your app

68
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,882
supports drawing, writing

69
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,483
or something else entirely,

70
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,852
exploring different types of interactions

71
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,220
like this can help

72
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,722
you create a richer and

73
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:36,556
more responsive

74
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,858
experience for your app. Bye!
