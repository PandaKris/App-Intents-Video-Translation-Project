00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:02,302
Hi! In this video, we are going to talk

2
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:03,403
about a feature that

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,071
connects hardware and software

4
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:07,240
in a very practical way, the Action Button.

5
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:08,875
Many people don't

6
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,443
know about it, but it can be

7
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,579
a powerful way for users to interact

8
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:14,280
with your app, especially when

9
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,082
combined with shortcuts and app intents.

10
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,518
By the end of this video,

11
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:19,219
you'll know what the Action

12
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:21,488
Button is, how it works, and how

13
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:23,623
to use it with the shortcuts you created

14
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,861
during this course.

15
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,529
The Action Button is a physical button

16
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,565
found on some Apple devices, like certain

17
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,200
iPhone models and the Apple

18
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,404
Watch Ultra. On devices that

19
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,206
support it, the button replaces or adds

20
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:41,541
two traditional controls

21
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,343
and lets the user customize

22
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,746
what it does. For example, it can open

23
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,348
an app, run a shortcut,

24
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,350
or start a system action.

25
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,119
It's a quick way to do something even

26
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,387
when the screen is locked.

27
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:57,090
Because it's designed to be

28
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,859
used fast and often without looking at

29
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,127
the screen, the best

30
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,929
actions are the simple ones.

31
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,865
Many people use it to open the camera,

32
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,500
turn on the flashlight,

33
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,202
start a voice recording,

34
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:13,239
or activate a focus mode. These are all

35
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:14,407
the things that work well

36
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,842
when they happen right away,

37
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:19,312
without extra steps. For us developers,

38
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:20,780
the best part is that we

39
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,115
don't need to change anything.

40
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,518
If we already created a shortcut using

41
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,786
app intents, the user

42
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,221
can choose that shortcut

43
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:31,858
for the Action Button. This is done in

44
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,659
the device settings.

45
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,495
So, just by supporting app

46
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,597
intents, your app is already ready to

47
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,898
work with the Action Button.

48
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,201
It's another way to make your

49
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,137
app more useful. Let me show you how this

50
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,039
works. I'll open the

51
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,974
Settings app on my iPhone, go to

52
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,577
the Action Button section, and pick one

53
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:51,644
of the shortcuts we

54
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,213
built earlier in the course.

55
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,150
The system allows me to assign it to the

56
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,185
button. Now, every

57
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,420
time I press the button,

58
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:03,456
that shortcut will run. No extra steps

59
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,692
needed. This is a great

60
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,894
example of how app intents make

61
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,164
our work more flexible and powerful.

62
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,198
Make sure the Action Button

63
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,399
gives a good experience,

64
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,335
there are some guidelines we should follow.

65
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,238
The action should be quick and

66
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,106
simple. It should not

67
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,675
ask the user for extra input or confirmation.

68
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,478
The user might press the

69
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,646
button while the device

70
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:30,416
is locked or in a pocket. So, the action

71
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,851
should run right away.

72
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,321
It's also a good idea to give

73
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,857
some feedback, like a sound, a vibration,

74
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,392
or something on screen.

75
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,661
This helps the user know

76
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:45,231
that the button worked. And finally, use

77
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,967
short and clear labels for your actions.

78
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,104
Three words or less is a good rule.

79
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,176
And that's it for this video.

80
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,343
The Action Button may seem like a

81
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,279
small detail, but it gives users

82
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,814
another easy and direct way to use what

83
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,783
we have built. And if you

84
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,552
are already using app intents,

85
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,021
you're almost done. Thanks for watching,

86
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,089
and see you in the next lesson. Bye!
