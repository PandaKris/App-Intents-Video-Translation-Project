00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,736
Hello, I'm Luna. In this video,

2
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:05,305
we will discuss the evolution of user interface

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:08,008
and how artificial intelligence

4
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:10,443
is introducing a new paradigm that will

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,679
completely change the way we interact

6
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,347
with computers and devices.

7
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:19,719
To understand this shift,

8
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,155
let's explore the two major paradigms that

9
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,757
have shaped this evolution.

10
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,593
First paradigm: Batch Processing.

11
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:30,964
Emerging around 1945,

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,900
this model required users to define

13
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,669
the entire workflow that the computer

14
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:38,405
needed to execute, run the program,

15
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,273
and then wait for the result.

16
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:43,610
An example of this would be processing

17
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:45,712
bank transactions for payroll.

18
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,248
A batch of punched cards was inserted

19
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:51,117
into the machine, which calculated

20
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,886
the employee's salaries in sequence.

21
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,855
Without human intervention during the process,

22
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,591
the interaction with the

23
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,794
computer was extremely limited.

24
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:04,330
If the outcome was incorrect or contained errors,

25
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,567
it could take days to apply

26
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:08,768
corrections and then

27
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,136
wait for new results.

28
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,174
Due to the limitations of this model,

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,642
a second paradigm emerged.

30
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,211
Command-Based Interaction

31
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:23,016
Introduced around 1965,

32
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:25,885
this model allowed users to issue commands

33
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,921
and receive responses from the computer,

34
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,023
enabling continuous

35
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,358
adjustments based on the results.

36
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,829
This model evolved through three

37
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,264
generations of interface technology.

38
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,569
First Generation, Command Line Interface

39
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,005
Second Generation,

40
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,974
Full-Screen Text-Based Terminals.

41
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,210
Third Generation,

42
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,445
graphical user interface

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,182
The last one has remained dominant for

44
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,685
almost 40 years, ever since

45
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,654
the launch of Macintosh in 1984.

46
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,593
The key advantage of graphical user interfaces

47
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,162
is their visual feedback after each command,

48
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,231
providing users with

49
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,532
a clear status update.

50
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,569
This format has dominated for over 60 years,

51
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,739
but now AI is changing

52
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,174
the dynamics of interaction,

53
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,077
giving rise to the third paradigm.

54
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,247
Intent-Based Outcome Specification

55
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,850
In this model, the user describes

56
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,887
what they want, and the system powered by

57
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,723
artificial intelligence interprets

58
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:40,026
the user's intent and executes the necessary

59
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,262
actions to deliver

60
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:43,429
the expected results.

61
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,365
For example,

62
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,034
requesting to generate an image

63
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,671
Unlike command-based interaction,

64
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,541
where hundreds of commands might be needed

65
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,310
to achieve the desired outcome,

66
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,345
in this paradigm a single prompt

67
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,748
can generate the intended image.

68
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,652
Although this approach is revolutionary,

69
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,889
it is important to note that the AI agent

70
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,759
may misinterpret the user's intent.

71
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,563
The user may fail to articulate their

72
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,064
requests correctly,

73
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,734
leading to unexpected results.

74
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:31,010
To minimize errors and enhance

75
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,645
the user and system experience

76
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,382
There are guidelines that when applied

77
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,619
to AI agents, make intents more effective

78
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,721
and efficient, and will be

79
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,389
presented in the next video.

80
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,961
I hope you enjoyed the discussion.

81
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,395
Thank you for your attention,

82
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,764
and see you next time. Bye!
