00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:02,502
Hello, in this video I will present

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,038
usability guidelines for designing system

3
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,273
experience with AI agents

4
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:10,243
to create more intuitive and transparent

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,012
interactions that align

6
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,580
with user expectations.

7
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:19,753
But first, let's understand what an AI

8
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:21,688
agent is by definition.

9
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,793
An AI agent is an intelligent system

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,028
that perceives the environment,

11
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,365
makes decisions and executes tasks without the

12
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,101
need for constant human interaction with

13
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,203
the interface, such as Siri.

14
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,673
It's important to remember that these

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,809
guidelines were partially based on

16
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,346
Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics,

17
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,415
which have been proven over the years.

18
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,985
And since this is an interaction between

19
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,220
humans and machines,

20
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,189
they can be applied to AI agents.

21
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,092
Let's present these guidelines.

22
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,796
First, set clear expectations up front.

23
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,534
Users must know what the AI agent

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,438
is capable of and what it is not capable of,

25
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,239
meaning they should be informed about

26
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:16,242
these limitations and capabilities

27
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:19,479
in a simple and objective way,

28
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,748
avoiding the creation of unrealistic expectations.

29
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,518
For example, an app intent of health tips

30
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,620
in a health habits app.

31
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:31,458
The intent could be: "Get wellness tips

32
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:34,027
and Health Habits" and receive a response like,

33
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,296
"What topic would you like a tip on?

34
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,298
Remember, I can't

35
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,866
provide medical diagnoses."

36
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,802
This way, the app intent would be

37
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,038
configured that the user clearly

38
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,540
understand the assistant's,

39
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,076
capabilities and limitations,

40
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,978
avoiding unrealistic expectations.

41
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,382
Second, match the agent's behavior with

42
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,017
the user's context and norms.

43
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,421
The AI agent must identify the context

44
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:05,158
and the moment the user is in,

45
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,560
so that they are not interrupted or the language

46
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,429
adapts to the cultural context.

47
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,333
For example, an app intent configured

48
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,002
to prevent the user from receiving reminders

49
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,072
or notifications while in a meeting.

50
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,642
This way, it could detect that the user

51
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,679
is in a meeting through the calendar

52
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,015
and once it has ended,

53
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,316
send a reminder or notification.

54
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,220
The app intent would respect

55
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,622
the user's context,

56
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:38,458
avoiding notifications at undesired moments.

57
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,326
Third, provide

58
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,962
transparency and explainability.

59
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,499
Based on the first usability heuristic,

60
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,636
visibility of system status.

61
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:53,706
The AI agent must provide clear feedback

62
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:57,110
on decision, which can be done through

63
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,913
a simple justification or an interface

64
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,514
that shows how it arrived

65
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,249
at that recommendation.

66
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,920
For example, an app intent of work directions

67
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,322
in a map's application.

68
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,893
The intent could be: "Get directions

69
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,163
to work" and would return with route options

70
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,965
based on time and distance

71
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,100
and the best option.

72
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,269
In this case, the app intent would

73
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,772
provide clear justification to the user

74
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:29,108
about why that route was suggested,

75
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,177
allowing them

76
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,046
to understand the system's logic.

77
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,249
Fourth, support user

78
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,184
control and easy escapes.

79
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,589
Based on third usability heuristic,

80
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:43,823
user control and freedom.

81
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,594
The user must have control over the AI

82
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,630
being able to reveal, correct,

83
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,832
confirm and even cancel what

84
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,400
is presented easily.

85
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,836
The final decision must

86
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,605
always belong to the user.

87
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,609
For example, an app intent of enhanced

88
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,612
image in a photo editing app.

89
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,782
The intent could be: "Get auto enhance"

90
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,052
Once done, it could show the result of

91
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,021
the photo with options to change contrast,

92
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,657
brightness and saturation.

93
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,227
This app intent would ensure that

94
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,329
the user has total control,

95
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,231
preventing undesired actions

96
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,499
and allowing quick adjustments.

97
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,602
Fifth, handle errors

98
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,537
and uncertainty gracefully.

99
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:36,209
Based on ninth usability heuristic,

100
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,011
help users recognize, diagnose

101
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,213
and recover from errors.

102
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,283
The AI agent must recognize when it's

103
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,686
wrong or uncertain and

104
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,855
handle this intuitively.

105
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,392
This includes avoiding risky actions,

106
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,695
providing clear error messages and always

107
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,797
offering the user a next step.

108
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,000
For example, an app intent of add to

109
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,336
playlist in a streaming music app.

110
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,406
When a song was playing, the user could

111
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,707
activate the intent.

112
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,978
Add music to playlist Workout and receive

113
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,314
a response like, "I couldn't find the

114
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,182
Playlist Workout.

115
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,050
What would you like to do?"

116
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:20,386
and would give the options.

117
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,922
Create a new Playlist called Workout

118
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,158
or choose an existing playlist.

119
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,028
This way, the app intent could be

120
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:31,065
configured to handle cases where

121
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,767
the requested playlist is not found,

122
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,103
responding in a friendly way and offering

123
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,338
alternative actions.

124
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:39,973
Sixth, enable

125
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,475
feedback loops and learning.

126
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,511
A simple way to collect feedback is

127
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,113
to offer ratings or quick

128
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,215
surveys after an interaction.

129
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,618
This allows the system to be continuously

130
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,355
adjusted based on users' response.

131
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,358
For example, an app intent of movie

132
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,827
and series recommender in a streaming app.

133
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:01,962
The intent could be

134
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,364
recommend a TV series.

135
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,700
The app would respond with a suggestion

136
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,102
and follow feedback options,

137
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:11,572
"Love" or "Suggest less".

138
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,775
Depending on the user's choice,

139
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:17,211
the app would adjust its future suggestions,

140
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:20,414
making them more personalized and aligned

141
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,416
with their tastes over time.

142
00:06:23,118 --> 00:06:24,452
Seventh, learning from

143
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,421
user behavior over time.

144
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:29,824
Allow the AI agent to learn from user

145
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:31,292
preference over time

146
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,527
in a transparent manner.

147
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,764
Personalization proves the experience,

148
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:37,832
but must be done with the

149
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,567
user's consent and control.

150
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:42,303
For example, an app intent of a schedule

151
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,005
meeting in a meeting app.

152
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,408
The intent could be "Schedule a meeting for tomorrow"

153
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:50,111
and receive a response like,

154
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,981
"It looks like you usually schedule

155
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:56,951
meetings at 9am, so I will use that time.

156
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,520
What do you want to call it?"

157
00:06:59,554 --> 00:07:01,322
If the user confirms the meeting is created,

158
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:04,025
the app intent would learn

159
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,294
the user's preferred times with their

160
00:07:06,361 --> 00:07:09,030
permission to enhance future experience.

161
00:07:09,998 --> 00:07:12,033
These are some guidelines for creating

162
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,836
more efficient and effective app intents.

163
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:18,339
By following these practices,

164
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:20,108
you improve your app's integration with the system

165
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:22,977
and deliver a smoother user experience.

166
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,484
I hope you enjoyed our content about

167
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,785
design for app intent.

168
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,754
Thank you for your time and attention.

169
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,923
See you later. Bye!
