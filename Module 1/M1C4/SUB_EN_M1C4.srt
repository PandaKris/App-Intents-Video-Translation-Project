00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:02,335
Hi! In this video you are going to dive

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:03,636
into the building blocks

3
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:05,205
that make system interactions

4
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:07,207
like shortcuts,

5
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:08,942
Siri and Spotlight possible.

6
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,346
If you already explored what a shortcut is

7
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:16,016
and how it fits into the Apple ecosystem,

8
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,752
you are ready to go one layer deeper.

9
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,590
App intents are how your app

10
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,291
communicates with the system,

11
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,659
making features discoverable,

12
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:29,729
actionable and smarter.

13
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,899
Whether you are aiming to integrate

14
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,035
with Siri, power up your widgets

15
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:38,038
or prepare your app for app intelligence,

16
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,673
understanding App Intents is essential

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,975
to unlocking seamless

18
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,910
contextual experiences.

19
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,881
This diagram illustrates the role of App

20
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,216
Intents as the bridge between

21
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,584
your app and the system features

22
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,987
users interact with every day.

23
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,157
At the bottom, we have your app

24
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,558
containing all your logic,

25
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,794
features and data.

26
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,363
On top of that sits

27
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,631
the App Intents layer,

28
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,600
which exposes specific actions from your

29
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,904
app in a structured, system-readable way.

30
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,741
Then, at the very top, you see powerful

31
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,076
system experience like Siri,

32
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:18,344
Spotlight and Shortcuts.

33
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:21,915
These green tiles represent

34
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,683
the users' facing features

35
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,553
that become smarter and more useful when

36
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,122
your app provides well-defined intents.

37
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,259
In short, App Intents are how

38
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,062
your app plugs into the wider Apple ecosystem,

39
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,731
enabling seamless, natural

40
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,767
and intelligent user experiences.

41
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,538
So now that we understand where

42
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,240
App Intents fits in, let's talk

43
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,577
about what an intent actually is.

44
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,813
An intent is a clear, self-contained

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,348
action that represents

46
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,217
something your app can do.

47
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,320
It's not a screen or a feature, 

48
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,655
it's a specific task.

49
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:07,961
Like Log 500 mL of water,

50
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:11,464
start a strength workout or send 20 bucks to Alex.

51
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,534
Each intent is defined with the

52
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,903
information it needs to run,

53
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,472
like parameters, inputs and outputs,

54
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,842
so the system knows exactly

55
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,210
how to describe and execute it.

56
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,046
You can think of intents

57
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,448
as the vocabulary of your app.

58
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,618
The set of things it knows how to do,

59
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,686
described in a way that's both

60
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,556
human-friendly and machine-readable.

61
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,225
And here's where things

62
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,827
get even more interesting.

63
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,497
While, in the past, it was enough

64
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,999
to expose your app's main

65
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,334
features as intents,

66
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,169
Apple's new guidelines

67
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,471
encouraged a broader approach.

68
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,473
Everything your app does

69
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:55,608
should be an App intent.

70
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,646
This means every action,

71
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,748
no matter how small,

72
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,983
should be defined in a way that

73
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,686
the system can understand and interact with.

74
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:08,388
It's a shift toward

75
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,089
making your App more modular,

76
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,825
expressive and ready to work seamlessly

77
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,627
across the entire ecosystem.

78
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:19,165
Now that we have covered what App intents

79
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,367
are and why they matter,

80
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,003
it's time to look at the framework that

81
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,672
makes it all possible.

82
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,976
In the hands-on module, we'll focus on

83
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,444
the developer side

84
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,845
of the App intents framework,

85
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,182
exploring its capabilities,

86
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,518
understanding how to define and structure intents

87
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,621
and walking through lots of example code.

88
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,856
One of the best parts?

89
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,061
The entire framework is built to work

90
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,129
natively with Swift.

91
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,599
That means you can

92
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,367
define all your intents

93
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,602
and connect with system

94
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,670
features using just code,

95
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,906
not files or external

96
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,140
configuration needed.

97
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,843
These make it easier

98
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,612
to collaborate with teammates,

99
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,381
track changes through version control,

100
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:09,415
and keep your

101
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,651
workflow simple and scalable.

102
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,188
To wrap things up,

103
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,357
the goal of this model was

104
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,125
to help you better understand

105
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,793
the relevance of system

106
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,996
experience in the Apple ecosystem.

107
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,798
To get familiar with features like,

108
00:04:25,963 --> 00:04:26,600
Siri

109
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,500
Shortcuts

110
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,100
and Spotlight

111
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,900
and to recognize that all of those are powered by

112
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:34,707
App Intents, defined by you, the developer.

113
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,478
These intents are what allow your app

114
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,913
to truly connect with the system

115
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,483
and deliver rich, personalized interactions.

116
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,889
There are countless possible use cases.

117
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,259
Your app should aim to support

118
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,461
all of those that make sense for your user.

119
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,631
Thanks for watching!

120
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,200
We hope it gives you a clear starting

121
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,036
point for making your apps more

122
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,470
intelligent, accessible

123
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,039
and deeply integrated.

124
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:07,273
Bye!
