00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:02,802
Hello, everyone. Welcome. I'm Giovanna,

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:04,704
and today we'll be talking about

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,906
an essential concept for developing apps

4
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:07,774
in the Apple ecosystem,

5
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,477
which is system experience.

6
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:12,946
System experience is the deep

7
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,048
and consistent integration of an app

8
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,417
with native operating system functionalities,

9
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,120
enabling users to interact with the app

10
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,422
seamlessly throughout system-provided features,

11
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,125
even without opening it.

12
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:27,160
Hey Siri.

13
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,731
Play the System Experience class.

14
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,641
Some of the key technologies

15
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,709
provided by the system

16
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,210
to ensure this integration include

17
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,847
Spotlight, which allows content from

18
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,683
your app to appear in system searches enabling

19
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,453
users to discover and directly

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,955
access specific parts of your app

21
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:58,358
without manually opening it.

22
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,361
Siri, which lets your app respond

23
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,029
to voice commands,

24
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,697
offering customized actions

25
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,667
like send a message or log a task

26
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,803
through voice interactions.

27
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,339
Shortcuts, empowering your app to provide

28
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,875
reusable and automatable actions that

29
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,311
users can combine with other apps.

30
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,648
Ideal for creating quick and personalized

31
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,950
experiences without any UI.

32
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,420
Controls, available in the new Control Center,

33
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,323
allowing your app to expose

34
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,459
functionalities as system-accessible

35
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:33,993
buttons at any time.

36
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:37,964
Widgets, displaying information

37
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,667
or actions from your app directly

38
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,269
on the home screen, lock screen or StandBy,

39
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,438
enable users to interact

40
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,941
quickly without opening your app.

41
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,078
Live activities, providing real-time

42
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,447
updates on the lock screen and dynamic island,

43
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,050
perfect for tracking deliveries,

44
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,985
timers or live scores.

45
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,822
Focus integration, enables your app

46
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,692
to suggest content filters or adapt

47
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,827
its behavior based on the user's current context,

48
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,696
such as work,

49
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,098
personal or sleep modes.

50
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,602
And hardware interactions,

51
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,171
like the action button or Apple pencil gestures,

52
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,207
allowing your app to respond to physical,

53
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,710
customizable actions like triggering

54
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,312
features or activating shortcuts quickly.

55
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,482
It's essential for your app to be deeply

56
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,051
integrated with the system to meet user

57
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,153
expectations and remain relevant.

58
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,390
With Apple Intelligence,

59
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,225
users will increasingly access your app's

60
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,828
functionality without even opening it,

61
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,463
making these integrations

62
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,998
more important than ever.

63
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,969
Fortunately, all the technologies

64
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,538
mentioned earlier are

65
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,306
already available, and you can

66
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,475
start preparing your app right now

67
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,509
for this growing demand.

68
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,512
The good news is that implementing these

69
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,915
integrations require far less code

70
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,116
and effort than it might

71
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,050
initially seem.

72
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,353
This seamless, proactive experience

73
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,288
is quickly becoming the

74
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,857
standard user expect,

75
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,091
shaping the future of interaction

76
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,960
across the Apple ecosystem.

77
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:17,730
Thank you so much

78
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:18,998
for your time and attention.

79
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,701
Throughout this course, our goal

80
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,536
will be to deepen your knowledge about these

81
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,604
native technologies,

82
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,340
exploring in detail how they work and the

83
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,708
possibilities they offer.

84
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,211
You'll see multiple hands-on examples

85
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,745
to help you clearly understand

86
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,380
and implement these integrations.

87
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,684
Ultimately, we aim to empower you

88
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,286
to confidently identify use cases

89
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,688
and integrate them effectively

90
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,656
into the apps you are developing.

91
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,458
Until the next video!
