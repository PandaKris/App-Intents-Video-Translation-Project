00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:03,470
Hi there, my name is Sergio

2
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:04,671
and in this video we are going

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,573
to explore what a shortcut is.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,476
How the Shortcuts apps fits into the user

5
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:10,710
experience and how

6
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,412
automations can create seamless,

7
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,447
contextualized interactions across devices.

8
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:17,083
Whether you're

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,585
looking to improve your own

10
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:21,287
workflows or make your apps more powerful

11
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,389
through integration,

12
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,325
understanding shortcuts is a key step in

13
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,060
building smarter experiences.

14
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:32,599
A shortcut is a custom sequence

15
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:33,933
of actions that can be

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,202
triggered manually or automatically

17
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,204
to perform tasks across

18
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,373
apps and system services.

19
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,144
Think of it as a lightweight automation

20
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,513
tool built right into the ecosystem.

21
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,650
For example, a user might create

22
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,219
a shortcut that logs their latest workouts

23
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,621
from the fitness app,

24
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:56,523
updates a spreadsheet

25
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,757
in numbers with this data,

26
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,326
and sends a summary to their personal

27
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,797
trainer via messages, all in one go.

28
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:08,001
Others might set up shortcuts that start a timer,

29
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,904
turn on "Do Not Disturb"

30
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,674
and open their Focus app when

31
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,810
beginning a deep work session.

32
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,447
From sending a daily

33
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,649
progress report via email,

34
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,151
to logging in using a health app,

35
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,787
to generating voices using

36
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,622
data from notes or calendar,

37
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,057
the possibilities are

38
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,159
broad and highly customizable.

39
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,664
For developers, supporting shortcuts

40
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,332
means empowering users

41
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,700
to integrate your app

42
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,435
into their everyday flows

43
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,370
without even opening it.

44
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,308
The Shortcuts app is Apple's Visual

45
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,642
interface for building,

46
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,078
managing and running shortcuts.

47
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,015
It provides a drag and drop style editor

48
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,851
where users can chain

49
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,586
together actions from both

50
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:02,422
system and third-party apps, to create

51
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,690
powerful automations.

52
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,425
No code required.

53
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,295
For developers, the Shortcuts app

54
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,864
is where your app's exposed

55
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,866
app intents come to life,

56
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,668
allowing users to discover and use your

57
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,371
functionality in entirely new contexts.

58
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,242
It is not just a power user tool.

59
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,111
It's a key part of how users extend

60
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,580
and personalize their Apple devices.

61
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,684
An automation is a type of shortcut that

62
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,086
runs automatically based

63
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:34,554
on predefined triggers,

64
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,991
like time of day, location,

65
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,326
device activity, or even interactions with

66
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,663
accessories such as NFC tags and AirTags.

67
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,735
Unlike regular shortcuts, automations

68
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,271
do not require manual input to start,

69
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,340
although some may ask for confirmation

70
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,242
depending on the context.

71
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,079
For example, a user might set up

72
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,315
an automation to start playing a podcast

73
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,517
when they connect to the car's Bluetooth

74
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,555
or to silence notifications when

75
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,256
they open a meditation app.

76
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,993
Developers can tap into this system

77
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,562
by exposing app intents that

78
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,630
users can incorporate into automations,

79
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,833
allowing your app to respond

80
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,669
to real-world triggers

81
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,304
and become part of a seamless,

82
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,172
context-aware experience.

83
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,143
At the core of every shortcut

84
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,711
or automation is an action.

85
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,213
a single task that

86
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,882
a user's device can perform.

87
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,853
As a developer, you are responsible

88
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,121
to define these actions

89
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,557
by exposing functionality from your app

90
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,326
through the App Intents framework.

91
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,561
The action you provide

92
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,063
becomes a building block

93
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,497
that users can include

94
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,132
in their own shortcuts,

95
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,369
making your app more accessible,

96
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,871
useful and integrated across the system.

97
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,808
By carefully designing meaningful,

98
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,543
context-aware actions,

99
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,745
you are not just adding a feature.

100
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,281
You are extending your app into

101
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,682
the user's daily routine

102
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,385
in powerful and personalized ways.

103
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,422
Thanks for watching,

104
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,824
and we appreciate your taking

105
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,392
this time to explore

106
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,893
the Apple shortcuts with us.

107
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,095
As you have seen,

108
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,063
shortcuts and automations

109
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,266
are powerful ways to create more fluid,

110
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,434
personalized the experiences

111
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,603
across Apple ecosystem.

112
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,841
And as a developer, you play a key role

113
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,542
in making that possible.

114
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,045
In our next video, we will dive deeper

115
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,813
into the App Intents framework.

116
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,116
We'll walk through how

117
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,018
to define and expose actions

118
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,453
from your app step by step.

119
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:48,721
See you there.
