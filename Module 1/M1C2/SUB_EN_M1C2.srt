00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:03,003
Hello everyone, welcome! In today's video

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:03,970
we are going to dive

3
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,505
deeper into one of the most

4
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,774
iconic features of the Apple ecosystem,

5
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:10,443
Siri. Our main objective

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,078
is to understand what Siri

7
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,681
really is, how it works, and what it

8
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,717
enables users to do across Apple devices.

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,755
Whether it's through voice commands,

10
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,390
smart suggestions,

11
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,624
or deep app integration,

12
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:26,826
Siri plays a key role in making

13
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:28,795
interactions more natural and intuitive.

14
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:30,864
And with the arrival of Apple Intelligence,

15
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,232
it's about to

16
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,900
become even more powerful.

17
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,904
Siri was introduced in 2011 as the

18
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,205
world's first widely

19
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,774
available virtual assistant,

20
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,643
with the goal of helping users interact

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,644
with their devices

22
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,146
using natural language.

23
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,748
Over the years, it has evolved from

24
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:49,983
handling simple voice commands,

25
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,352
like setting alarms or sending messages,

26
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,021
to supporting a wide

27
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,656
range of functionalities,

28
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,591
including controlling smart home devices,

29
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,628
launching apps,

30
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,363
providing proactive suggestions,

31
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,131
and executing custom shortcuts.

32
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,802
Its core purpose has always been to make

33
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:11,604
everyday tasks faster, more convenient,

34
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,207
and more accessible by reducing

35
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,208
the friction between

36
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,876
the user and the technology.

37
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,647
Today, Siri can be used in a wide range

38
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:21,848
of practical scenarios

39
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,349
across Apple devices.

40
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,520
For example, on an iPhone, a user can say

41
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,857
"Hey Siri, send a message to João saying

42
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,593
"I'll be there in 10 minutes."

43
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,527
And Siri will compose the message,

44
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,229
confirm the content,

45
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,566
and send it via the Messages app.

46
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:42,368
Another common use case is asking 

47
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,838
"Hey Siri, what's the weather like tomorrow in São Paulo?"

48
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:47,407
Which brings up

49
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:48,975
the weather app with a spoken

50
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,445
summary and visual forecast.

51
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:55,515
On Apple Watch, users can lift their wrist and say

52
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,650
"Start an outdoor walk."

53
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,687
And Siri will begin tracking the workout instantly.

54
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:04,791
For productivity, users can say

55
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,759
"Remind me to call

56
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,729
Anna when I get home." And Siri will use

57
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,331
geolocation to trigger that

58
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,032
reminder at the right moment.

59
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,570
Siri can also run custom shortcuts.

60
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,140
For instance, a user might say

61
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,576
"Hey Siri, order my usual coffee."

62
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,744
Which triggers a preconfigured shortcut

63
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,479
in a full delivery app.

64
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:29,549
These examples show how Siri

65
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,518
enables fast, contextual,

66
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,253
and hands-free interactions

67
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,589
that go beyond basic voice commands,

68
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,591
and enhances in the user experience through

69
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,360
intelligence automation.

70
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,931
Despite all its capabilities,

71
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,165
Siri still has some important limitations.

72
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,801
It may occasionally

73
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,837
misinterpret what the user says,

74
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,572
especially in noisy

75
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,674
environments or when dealing with less

76
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,544
common names and commands.

77
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,013
In more complex requests, it can struggle

78
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:00,880
to maintain the context of a conversation,

79
00:03:02,147 --> 00:03:03,683
requiring the user

80
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,784
to repeat or rephrase instructions.

81
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,187
Additionally, while Siri

82
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,823
supports multiple languages,

83
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,493
its performance can vary.

84
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,295
Some languages or regions have more

85
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,263
limited functionality compared to English.

86
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,867
These limitations can affect

87
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,435
the overall user experience,

88
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,638
particularly for users relying on Siri

89
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,440
in non-English contexts

90
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,942
or expecting more natural,

91
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,612
conversational interactions.

92
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,580
With the introduction of App Intelligence,

93
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,782
many of Siri's current

94
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,984
limitations are expected to be

95
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,920
significantly reduced.

96
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,488
App Intelligence brings a new level

97
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,791
of understanding to Siri by combining

98
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,559
on-device processing with

99
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,995
large language models,

100
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,598
allowing for more accurate interpretations

101
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,633
of user commands, even when they

102
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,702
are complex or conversational.

103
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,304
This means Siri will be better

104
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,572
at following multi-step instructions,

105
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,941
remembering context

106
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,210
between interactions, and understanding

107
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,345
more natural language

108
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,846
without requiring perfect phrasing.

109
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,149
Another major improvement is

110
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,753
the use of personal contexts.

111
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,821
Siri will be able to draw from

112
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,624
the user's calendar, messages, emails,

113
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,892
and files, securely and privately

114
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,228
to provide smarter

115
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,732
and relevant responses. For example,

116
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,533
you might ask, "When is my

117
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,836
next meeting with Lucas?"

118
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,939
or "Send the file Anna shared with me last week."

119
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,242
And Siri will know exactly

120
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,477
what you are referring to.

121
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,647
In addition, Siri will be integrated

122
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,016
with ChatGPT, allowing users

123
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,917
to seamlessly access even

124
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,286
more powerful AI capabilities

125
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:50,323
when needed, such as writing an email,

126
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,891
draft or brainstorming ideas,

127
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,395
always with user permission. Altogether,

128
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,197
App Intelligence transforms Siri from

129
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,067
a command-based assistant in a truly

130
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,569
intelligent personal companion

131
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,405
that understands the user's world.

132
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:09,942
Thank you so much for your time

133
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,811
and attention. In this video,

134
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,413
we explore what Siri is,

135
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,782
how it works today, and how it's

136
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:16,983
about to evolve with the power

137
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,084
of App Intelligence.

138
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,787
As we continue through this course,

139
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:21,988
our goal is to help you

140
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,723
understand how to make your app

141
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,626
accessible through Siri using the right

142
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,027
technologies like App

143
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,228
Intents and shortcuts.

144
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,931
You'll see practical examples that show

145
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,932
how to implement these

146
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,767
integrations step by step.

147
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,770
It's important to remember that users are

148
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,273
increasingly expecting to interact with

149
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,742
apps using voice and natural language.

150
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,744
And with the improvements coming to Siri,

151
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,980
these expectations will only grow.

152
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,416
Making your app available through Siri is not

153
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,584
just a nice-to-have,

154
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:55,388
it's become essential. See you, bye!
